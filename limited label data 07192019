multi nomical distrbrion


pi_iu^k  :  is 0.3 .0,5 etc



using EM  to deal with intrable to trable



underlying assumption 
1> objection is maximal.
2> guess initialiZationm
if bad, EM might not convergence

non uniqueness (same as KM)
confusion matrix to check if it is related to true label(even though we do not know)

p.s uniform distrinutiom is not good according to EM algorithm.

Experimentation Course

The course introduces the core concepts of A/B tests including the process of defining metrics, the statistical foundations behind A/B testing, and the trustworthy design, setup, and analysis of A/B tests. The concepts are demonstrated using recent examples of A/B tests run across a variety of Microsoft products, including Windows, Office, Bing, Microsoft News, and many more. Experimenters will find the material of value both prior to their first experiment as well as later in feature development work.

If you are interested in a more in-depth, hands-on lab specifically focused on helping you better analyze A/B tests using ExP's analysis tools, we recommend you also sign up for our companion course, ExP Lab .

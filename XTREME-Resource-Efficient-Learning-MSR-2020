RE: Conversational Pre-trained models for Cortana LU scenarios

[part1]


self-learning


dropout
0.2
 cannot too high or too low


 catastrophic forgetting


 meta tuning

 meta tunning 比self-learning 好

 [part 2]
 weak supervision
這邊也有用到self-learning 跟meta tuning 但是不是太懂   

 source of weak supervision

 focus on 'user behavior'

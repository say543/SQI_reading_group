The idea to have the following multi turn scenarios is to increase use successtion rate. By walking through those examples, there will be more clear picture




the first scenario is a two-turn dialogue

users want to trigger send email action but fail to provide message tex in the first turn.
Even though in the second turn users say  yes, email will not been sent
Therefore, yes should not be 'confirm' intent and it will keep the same intent as the previous intent continue the conversaion.


same situation will happen when user says 'No' or  'Cancel'. Becasue wthiout providing message, 
'No' and 'Cancel' should not be 'reject' and 'Cancel' intents, instead, they should be previous intents to continue conversation.

Is this clear?

above examples miss message.

for examples having message but missing email_subject we can apply the same logic here to continue the conversation.


the second scenario is a four-turn dialogue.

users try to inquiry what emails they have in the first turn,  
then select one email in the second turn, 
do 'reply' action in the third turn
becasue message is missed ,what users say in the four turn should be classified as 'message slot'
Therefore, the four turn should be the previous turn's intent to continue conversation.
In this example, it will be 'reply'.


same logic can be applied when users say 'forward' in the third turn as well.


Now this feature has been shipped to email dev flight
michael and i are thinking if this featurize can be apllied for doamins needing message slot.


eg: Teams status set might a potentila scenario but we might want to see how it wokrs in email domain

The idea to have the following multi turn scenarios is to increase use successtion rate. By walking through those examples, there will be more clear picture




the first example is a two-turn dialogue

users want to trigger send email action but fail to provide message text.
Even though in the second turn saying  yes, email will not been sent
so in this case. cortana should not say 'confirm' but it will keep the same intent as the previous email to continue the conversaion.


same situation will happen when user says 'No' or  'Cancel'   becasue wthiout providing message, the conversation should continue 
without 'Reject' or Cancel' intents 

the above examples miss message.

How about examples having message but missing email_subject? we can apply the same scenario here to keep communication



Is this clear?


Here is another scenario for a four-turn dialogue.

users try to inquiry what emails they have by the first turn,  
then select one email by the second turn, 
reply by the third turn
last turn should be classified as message.

Without this new scenario, the four turn will output different intents but here it should be calssified as reply to continuous conversation.

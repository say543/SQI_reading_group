1. Design LU model schemas
2. Collect modeling data from existing mystuff model wit schema mapping
3. Annotated new queries extracted from the answer spec
4. Build initial LU model
5. Quick evaluation
6. Deploy to M365Search virtual service


last week we fininalized the first version of schema. Yues sent it through email thread
we pulled qqueres from answer spec, annotated them and trained with existing teams related data and mystuff data with schema mapping.

and we ran a quick evaluation and deployed to MS365 search virtual service
This is URI to show
Yong also shareed schema, first dataset and link to file answer team.

The idea to have the following multi turn scenarios is to increase use successtion rate. By walking through those examples, there will be more clear picture




the first scenario is a two-turn dialogue

users want to trigger send email action but fail to provide message tex in the first turn.
Even though in the second turn users say  yes, email will not been sent
Therefore, yes should not be 'confirm' intent and it will keep the same intent as the previous intent continue the conversaion.


same situation will happen when user says 'No' or  'Cancel'. Becasue wthiout providing message, 
'No' and 'Cancel' should not be 'reject' and 'Cancel' intents, instead, they should be previous intents to continue conversation.

Is this clear?

above examples miss message.

for examples having message but missing email_subject we can apply the same logic here to continue the conversation.


the second scenario is a four-turn dialogue.

users try to inquiry what emails they have in the first turn,  
then select one email in the second turn, 
do 'reply' action in the third turn
becasue message is missed ,what users say in the four turn should be classified as 'message slot'
Therefore, the four turn should be the previous turn's intent to continue conversation.
In this example, it will be 'reply'.


same logic can be applied when users say 'forward' in the third turn as well.


Now this feature has been shipped to email dev flight
michael and i are thinking if this featurize can be apllied for doamins needing message slot.


eg: Teams status set might a potentila scenario but we might want to see how it wokrs in email domain

files presentation 07232019
=====================

the latest update for file domain is the feedback from partner team.
i have reviewed those and added my comments to my first dataset.
Also, i have asked  Ling to review the content
Ling seems having questions about schema so we can go through scheam questions at first
then move to my comments


==========================
email presentation 07232019
=====================

last week i mainly worked on three things
The first thing is to cowork with Dilion to veryify multi-trun new scenarios and it is done in email dev flight.
The second thing i started integrating the design in email build script and the PR is out for review
The third thing is related to files domain. The partner team has provided some comment about the first schema we proposed regarding
the first dataset.  Ling  also put on valualbe comments i am revising schema.

"answer service host" api service 
   for people , files and calendar only
   
   api serovce is to fetch index service after QAS workflows triggered by LU service by domain/intent/slot result
   
acronum using DW engine (not api to do that )


QAS WorkFlow 中間是zap

our model only provides trigger for QAS workflow

https://substrate.microsoft.net/documentation/
substrate model discussion

model A and model B  both services runniung on top of same machine
model B will call mobel A's service to serve request and model B has more extended restful service compared to A


model B2 service runs on the machine different from model A and models
provides more flexibility for customized logic where answee skill teams will
host there service 
  
  
  mode l A, B B2 belong to same cluster
  
right know cortana models hosted in model D
eventually will move to B2 snice D to A having to much latency

B2 in the same cluster as A and B so having lower lantency.
   

extended query serivce

good for system design 


how kd tree traverses with head/ tail vectors?


tombstone vector

tree update operation is good




multi teant
different partions for each user
each user has multiple data vectors


SSD servingi 
  tree /graph traversla
  1. drive too slow, cannot support high QPS
  2. in memory ? memcache does perform well since cache hit rate is pretty low
  
  solution:
    split vectors into head part / tail part
    
    head part
       using memory to store
       ? 
    tail part
        cluster or inverted index
          support to be drive
          
          
    how to search
    1. memory search tree  -> search graph
    ? 這個還沒聽完

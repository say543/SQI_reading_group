<jeff OMhover>


also aether

has wiki


heron has AML workspace

跟haoda 的pressentation 很像

also some new features
eg : data labeling


copy notebook to demo

example:
train sklearn routine


you can also create enviornment through code, <different from what haoda does>

chart to investigate different param / different experiementaton to see which is better



example2: distributed pytorch
可以參考  因為haoda 也是

pytorch estimator


example: pipeline executor
multiple scripts, move advanced features
interact with datastore
? similar to aether  搞不好也可以建在這邊

how to build up dependency? not pretty sure


examnple: deploy to cloud


? create api to hit

endpoint can setup permission


new features
hyperdrive
paramter search


example: compliant experiementation
rufous project
取代aether for compliant data 我因該也能用




AML can interact with Heron now

[people answer]
Zhiguo
there is a onenote page? asking for link


sss => 3s

some of them told by people teams

different from other searchs

slowSearchQualityOfSerivce
MSO provided

also other MSO related matrixs


good idea for our feature flight test  but this is not trigger scorecard

no using trigger scorecard: because trigger rate is very high.


MSOsearch success



[PME]
signed off by scorecard

skill team has its way to calculate

mainly talks about latency

assistant , flight 50% 50%

no trigger nottion in PME

for teams: it is hard to do that

autoNaviation:
     reading one meail finished then go to the next one
     
1024 1ms reduced


UPL : also including network latency



how to calculate session succes rate?
    similar to task complete rate
    
polite refusal rate?
    ask skill team to check

[part 2]

haoda
SBS tool and eyes-on/off
haoda

SBS tool is from bing


SBS tool setup

model D setup flight to only v1

how about v2? might be easier
v2 

asking onenote to check


not able to see special  logging for this.

good way:
to know pattern being used in e2e, success rate

also a module to collect based on pattens.

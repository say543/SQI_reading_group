good idea for our feature flight test  but this is not trigger scorecard

no using trigger scorecard: because trigger rate is very high.


MSOsearch success

signed off by scorecard

skill team has its way to calculate

mainly talks about latency

assistant , flight 50% 50%

no trigger nottion in PME

for teams: it is hard to do that

    ask skill team to check

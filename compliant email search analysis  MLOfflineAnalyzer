New Eyes-Off OfflineEvaluation Pipeline

Hi All,

Having several discussions with many of you we come up to conclusion that the current version of Aether365 NLAnalizer pipeline is much more enhanced than what we want to have going forward. It was created before shipping the NLEmailSearch and was more focused on simulation of the feature rather than measuring actual user experience. 

Shipping new version of the pipeline, which I hope will satisfy our needs going forward as we have shipped feature and we want to measure success as it is in OIVIC data.

Please note that the new version will be on target for HDI migration as a first priority. 

Please take a look. Feel free raise any questions. All comments and feedbacks are welcome.

new schema question?



soemthing move to HDI is needed  then this pipeline can be ran



might need permission.
need to be part of emailSearch project 


one group only has 20 people, so might not be able to run it

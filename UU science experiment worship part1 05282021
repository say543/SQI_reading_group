presentation 1:


step1 /step2

step3: asdebug to test three (going forward , using SBS tool is ok)


step4: control tower setup
a demo can be studifed in the future




good discussion -  auto-create isolitoon group / User existing isolation Group(this is choice when both experiemnts runinng flight, divided by percentage traffic)


vijay comment does not understand
scenario filteer?


setup up treatment/
another comment:
Nice reminder, if the flight doesn't need to call QAS, don't name the flight with prefix "luqas"
?  this one is not very clear to me.  we should go with lugas



seteup progression
  ? you can see other experiements . if wantting to share traffic, need to inform who owns the domain and also run experiement
  
step5: validation flight
parse your configuration

usualy you will see faile. i if those are unrelated to your change ,then just ignore.

@ saurabh

how to make sure conuterfiip work?
there is tool to filter


analysis scorebaord button  on scorebaaord 
?
trying to explain each group has 


a link fro a group metric triggering condition, need to insert into control tower scorecard 'Expression'



trigger scorecard setup
click 'clone'

same name ? not sure


33%  cojtrol  , impression, usertrigger


'get torus account credentials' => link (i needed)


a likn to describe the definition of each metric


filter score card ?
differen trigger confition setuo



expresion:
per scenario.
containskey ()
different for each SERP /answer:  calendar, people, files
also the whole 
name / how to log will affect how to write this expression
log will affect the whole expression

counterfactual logging(is in client side)



clinet benefit (from raj)

also need to pair with client (eg: resource clink)


files example
describe some issues we ecountered for scorecard revie

click metric to get a pop up detailed table, to get deifinitoon
column -> column denition (name, refer to link and git link)
git link to find column definition


routename? not deifiniotn in column definition
it is related to Immpression type


also script library provided (in score link)
good example (similar to previous slapi script i wrote)
scope you need to setup your acconut for torus credential


email search domain
no result flow for email : so recource link will not 100% (but otheres file serp without no result flow it wiil be 100%)


SERP abandant metrics
users abandan usage

answers PCR
  conversaion : one query called a conversation after click or button (switching tab will not create different conversaion)
  session id : certain period , but in trigger score card once suers uses feature, it has not time duration, it will always to true.
  
  same query  same logical impression but different page impression
  
anser CCR (clink)
   ? different from answer PCR, need to check later by myself.
   ? entity



session succes rate
time to sucess
  ? no defnition in page
  
 
 
 
people cluster positon?
    whether it is a shiftment or regression ? hard to decide it is good or bad is pretty hard
    
    
ming :
    satinity check (recource link = 100%) , the can be passed down to other modelers
 


model overtrigger?
   for files, need to check
   
   
scripts to ask another team as example?
     previously being turned down
     might be asking as a TEAM is better.
     
     KUOMING might use the same script to extra, might be we can talk to them.

@ eric
couhterfactual  signal and pipeline
definition of counterfactual logging
  good definition
  
  (currently signals are for SERP, not for answers, need to add to somewhere how answer checks trigger)
 
  good for introducing new models
  
  
  no good for iterating model
  ? why not balance , in design discussion channel ?
    becasue of new feature , triggering condtion 不同 所以ratio 不同
    但是我們因為要用tirgger scoreboard 因為traffic 太少
    
  proposal:
     control group => run new / old
     new to fix SRM pool
     old to get model result and aleration result then log
        
    
  
   
  SRM issue
    : sample ratio mismatch 
    
 
flow
  xap
  QAR : query alteration response
  wrapped in with CFI as QADD
  to 
  GWS
  into instrumentation payload
  
  to 
  ODIN/AURIGA (data cooking)
  to
  COSMOS

signals
  has definiton in keys , used in expression
  
  
  how to add news
  
  you need to do several things (in one note)



  how about answerting trigger metric ? should we add or ask answer team to add?
  


could we captue signal in QAS level ? not alteration level?
   then it can shared by both SERP and answer?
   no , according to document is is better ot add to alteration part
   
   
 trigger scorecard
   document :  < 50% you need to have 
      people : 40% then you do not need

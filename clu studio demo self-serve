data is not necessary 


model normalziation
   wrapper
   
   
add schema is necessary at first

unblock.
   new intent, new slot both works
   QAS ndees to change intents.classes
    slots.classes
    
    
evaluation result
   only through email to check
still need to wait
    for deploy, roll out time 
    
    
need to ask FST documentation for parners to work
#fst

B2 mobel not yet done?

alternative way

unify modeling 的feature 還沒在裡面

wcycle


import

data import is for evaluation?  or training  or both need to update

will deploy to self-serve
? b2 does not have self-serve


data is not necessary 


model normalziation
   wrapper
   
   
add schema is necessary at first

unblock.
   new intent, new slot both works
   QAS ndees to change intents.classes
    slots.classes
    
    
evaluation result
   only through email to check
still need to wait
    for deploy, roll out time 
    
    
need to ask FST documentation for parners to work
#fst



<unblock demo>

unclock need to depend on CMF structure ?
no, it can be new intent



# people
also lexicon



B2 mobel not yet done?

alternative way 
is to use clu studio to change model D

then manaully deploy to B2 through DPK




3:29
descrube what flows will be describe  what will not


9:00
describe edit intent related flow
new domain is also possible


21:00 
 import existing model

improt data is needed before import model

improt data format
wy need to import data? this is old flow,  not unified modeling . in the future, it might use git data to verify



28:00 
model import
https://microsoftapc.sharepoint.com/teams/STCACLUstudio/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fteams%2FSTCACLUstudio%2FShared%20Documents%2FGeneral%2FData%20Example%20Files&p=true&originalPath=aHR0cHM6Ly9taWNyb3NvZnRhcGMuc2hhcmVwb2ludC5jb20vOmY6L3QvU1RDQUNMVXN0dWRpby9Fb3ZhN0RNUjd4SkFwLU1tc1VBdUhsNEJFeGJnWVozOHNiT3Z2VDlCWU5vQm53P3J0aW1lPU9lUHJzc0U0MkVn


49:00
<possible error>
我卡在這邊的system failure
system failure 


49:00
這個時候只有單一個query
if import successes, then you can run test by a query


You can also run evaluation against data you import for evaluation staging 

50:00
If click deploy,   STATUS will become evaluating 
It will run evaluation against data you import for evaluation staging 
if metric is good, you can submit for review
    (?不知道是不是一定要run evaluation)
    
    
    
53:00
hotfix part


57:00
Exact match
you can change domain score/ intent / slot

1:00:00
add lit of queres, you can select  (this queries will be added to test evaluation if someone after doing change to the same domain, but not being part of traning data in the future)
STATUS will change to UserChecking

in the page you can also see difference and submit for review

evaluation result from email
reviewer 
    model owner
       some one from partner team
    model review admins
       in one of team
       
       
if revierwer approval
the STATUS will become reviewed and deploying
(techninicalliy  deploying  need time for QAS to check in and roll out)



1:10:08
pattern match

find #fstfood

# 是一個特別的symbol  for slot
( ? 因該不是#fst   要try 才知道 )

asking for documentation
and you can also add  test queriy against this pattern to define slot


1:12:00
another example
find a #people
(people is not defined)

people can can be expression or lexicon
and you can entity to this lexicon

expression
   you can ad drow
1:14:00 (many tedious can be used)  
entity
   you can add lexicon
   you can import from data management portal


1:15:00
unblock
沒有太多的examples
  new intent && new slot needs to use this
  
  add new intent example
  
     
  Not too much information to slot in this video, needs to try
  



clu studio new design 的討論 08/12/2020
will not be ready until two quarters later.

    aether is totally usable w just the vpn

I'll try that. So far I've used Aether only with non-compliant synthetic data.

Tao/Yaroslav, in what scenarios we will need to upload data to ADLS? I would assume most case is to use the extraction generated by Data team. Or we can apply other logic on the MDP extraction and create our own set?

Ming, such as eval config and model files
​[5:33 PM] Ming Wu
    
But we need to use DSVM for uploading eval config and model files?

And yes, we can create a different set than the annotated one. E.g., for OIVIC, it is 500K, and we only annotate 5K using target sampling. We can totally create a different set to do any kind of investigation

Not DSVM, in Aether
​[5:37 PM] Zhiguo Yu
    
Yaroslav, For DSVM, do we have details step by step documentation on how to log in and how to play with the data in this DSVM?

Get started with Azure Data Science Virtual Machine (DSVM) - Substrate Dev Center (microsoft.net)

Additional to Zhiguo's quesiton, do we detect/differentiate NL search queries vs. non-NL queries during sampling?
not exactly. We'll go into more detail in next week's brown bag, but the sampling logic itself is just based on eval domain scores. However currently I'm also including in the sampling pipeline a separate module that filters out single-word queries and some KQL prior to sampling  to increase NL percentage

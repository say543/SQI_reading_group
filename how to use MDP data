heron project to get ADSL link
this is something needed to run evaluation on compliance boundat
civp-2

adl://destadlsgrfwrqpnqwq5c.azuredatalakestore.net/ <= this is location part will be used
(p.s search queries and assistant queries are in different like civp civp2 / oivic / oivic-2  so heron id needs to be correct)



in modulo 'copy data from Mars to Mars (Auto approved)'
paaramter  EuclidWordSpaceID 這個是heron project 的id 也要configure 對

    aether is totally usable w just the vpn

I'll try that. So far I've used Aether only with non-compliant synthetic data.

Tao/Yaroslav, in what scenarios we will need to upload data to ADLS? I would assume most case is to use the extraction generated by Data team. Or we can apply other logic on the MDP extraction and create our own set?
​[5:32 PM] Tao Sun
    
Ming, such as eval config and model files
​[5:33 PM] Ming Wu
    
But we need to use DSVM for uploading eval config and model files?
​[5:33 PM] Tao Sun
    
And yes, we can create a different set than the annotated one. E.g., for OIVIC, it is 500K, and we only annotate 5K using target sampling. We can totally create a different set to do any kind of investigation

Not DSVM, in Aether
​[5:37 PM] Zhiguo Yu
    
Yaroslav, For DSVM, do we have details step by step documentation on how to log in and how to play with the data in this DSVM?
​[5:38 PM] Tao Sun
    
Get started with Azure Data Science Virtual Machine (DSVM) - Substrate Dev Center (microsoft.net)

Additional to Zhiguo's quesiton, do we detect/differentiate NL search queries vs. non-NL queries during sampling?
not exactly. We'll go into more detail in next week's brown bag, but the sampling logic itself is just based on eval domain scores. However currently I'm also including in the sampling pipeline a separate module that filters out single-word queries and some KQL prior to sampling  to increase NL percentage

speech continuation
  using websocket to connect
1% queries incomplete within 7 days
 目的: 在1% queries 讓user 有機會繼續continution 因為stop resent 的cost 很高?
 answer. 52% user got bing answer
    (? 是不是52% of 1% )
 
 question 有沒有數據說在1% 裡面 在apply idea 後  有多少queries supposed to end but mesh with following queries?

current bing if it stops 1% queries, cost is pretty high(maybe architecture wise)
so here we try to apply sppech continuation

client -  speech continution - speech service

中間曾慧detect client 要continue or end
也會開啟更多的web socket 如果要prefetch result

what is the direction ..... to Microsoft
<1>                          2>

<1> , <2> 都會有speech 然後search result
要combine or wait for <2> 是design choice, 沒有絕對


also,
incomplete query classifier might help to detect if continuing 

using entity , key pharse ('what is', etc...)
coverage it high enough already

   ? seems not word base but character base
   ? but why number is > 1, shouldn't it be percentage?
SIM
jaycorden , character level

catastrophic impact
?新的定義  有點難懂
關注keyword 這個keyword 跟user experience 有絕對的關西
ci 發生的probabilty 很高 when WER > 0.5 (因該說正相關所以加了這個來看)
